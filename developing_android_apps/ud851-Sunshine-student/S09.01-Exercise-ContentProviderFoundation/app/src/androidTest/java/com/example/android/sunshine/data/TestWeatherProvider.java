/**
 * Although these tests aren't a complete set of tests one should run on a ContentProvider
 * implementation, they do test that the basic functionality of Sunshine's ContentProvider is
 * working properly.
 * <p>
 * In this test suite, we have the following tests:
 * <p>
 *   1) A test to ensure that your ContentProvider has been properly registered in the
 *    AndroidManifest
 * <p>
 *   2) A test to determine if you've implemented the query functionality for your
 *    ContentProvider properly
 * <p>
 *   3) A test to determine if you've implemented the bulkInsert functionality of your
 *    ContentProvider properly
 * <p>
 *   4) A test to determine if you've implemented the delete functionality of your
 *    ContentProvider properly.
 * <p>
 * If any of these tests fail, you should see useful error messages in the testing console's
 * output window.
 * <p>
 * Finally, we have a method annotated with the @Before annotation, which tells the test runner
 * that the {@link #setUp()} method should be called before every method annotated with a @Test
 * annotation. In our setUp method, all we do is delete all records from the database to start our
 * tests with a clean slate each time.
