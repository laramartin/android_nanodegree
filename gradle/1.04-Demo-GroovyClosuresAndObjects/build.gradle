/*

Groovy has another way to declare functions called closures. Closures have
two interesting features. First, they are just values that can be assigned to
a variable, just like a number or a string. Second, they can capture variables
from the scope in which they're declared.

*/

task groovy {}

def foo = "One million dollars"
def myClosure = {
    println "Hello from a closure"
    println "The value of foo is $foo"
}

myClosure()
def bar = myClosure
def baz = bar
baz()

/*

Closures have a different notation for arguments.

*/

def doubleIt = { x -> x + x}

/*

Groovy also allows for higher order functions. That is, functions that take
functions as arguments. Let's make a function that applies another function
twice.

*/

def applyTwice(func, arg){
    func(func(arg))
}

foo = 5
def fooDoubledTwice = applyTwice(doubleIt, foo)
println "Applying doubleIt twice to $foo equals $fooDoubledTwice"

/*

A language where functions are just objects that can be passed around is
said to have "first class functions". The implications of this style of
programming go quite deep and beyond the scope of this course. A search for
"first class function" or "functional programming" will give you more
information.

Groovy allows for very sophisticated list processing using closures. We can
declare a list using a literal.

*/

def myList = ["Gradle", "Groovy", "Android"]

/*

We can execute a closure for each item in the list.

*/

def printItem = {item -> println "List item: $item"}
myList.each(printItem)

/*

We can make this notation much more compact by declaring the closure in-
line, and removing the parentheses. Also, if a closure accepts a single
argument, by default that argument is just called `it`.

*/

myList.each{println "Compactly printing each list item: $it"}

/*

Groovy has a simplified syntax for declaring classes. Note that these classes
are essentially to Java classes under the hood. Groovy automatically generates
getters and setters for class properties.

*/

class GroovyGreeter {
    String greeting = "Default greeting"
    def printGreeting(){println "Greeting: $greeting"}
}

def myGroovyGreeter = new GroovyGreeter()

myGroovyGreeter.printGreeting()
myGroovyGreeter.greeting = "My custom greeting"
myGroovyGreeter.printGreeting()

/*

The last Groovy feature we'll cover is that closures can have a delegate
object. Any variables or methods referenced in the closure that don't have a
local definition are then evaluated against the closure's delegate. Let's make
a closure that will access the property and method of our GroovyGreeter class.

*/

def greetingClosure = {
    greeting = "Setting the greeting from a closure"
    printGreeting()
}

// greetingClosure() // This doesn't work, because `greeting` isn't defined
greetingClosure.delegate = myGroovyGreeter
greetingClosure() // This works as `greeting` is a property of the delegate
