/*

The settings.gradle file is where we tell Gradle what subprojects to include
in the multi-project build. We already have the :app project for the Android
app, and we'll add :javaJokes

Now javaJokes is a subproject, and if we run

    $ ./gradlew projects

We see that both app and javaJokes are subprojects.

Finally, if we want to use code from javaJokes in our app project, we need to
declare a project dependency. Let's head over the build.gradle file in the app
directory.

include ':app', ':javaJokes'
